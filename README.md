### **üß† About Me**

I'm an Electronics Engineering, studied at Rizal Technological University, Philippines, with a growing passion for data science and its power to uncover structure in complexity.

I see technology not merely as a tool, but as a framework for understanding the world ‚Äî and data, its language. My academic path is shaped by a deep interest in applying mathematical reasoning and computational thinking to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I‚Äôm focusing on:

üìä Statistical learning & machine learning

üßÆ Mathematical modeling & algorithm design

üß† Exploring the philosophy of data: what we know, how we know it, and what we assume we know
