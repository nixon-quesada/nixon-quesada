### **About Me:**
Thanks for visiting! I am an **Electronics Engineering** undergraduate at **Rizal Technological University, Philippines**, driven by a deep curiosity about the interplay between data, technology, and human insight. To me, data science is not just a discipline—it’s a lens through which we can better understand complex systems and uncover hidden patterns that shape our world.

My academic journey is fueled by the belief that knowledge is a continuous pursuit, one that blends rigorous analysis with creativity and critical thinking. I actively contribute to open-source projects and challenge myself with problem-solving, embracing each obstacle as an opportunity to grow and refine my understanding.

Currently, **I am exploring projects that merge theoretical foundations with practical applications, aiming to create meaningful impact through data-driven innovation.**
